# Welcome to **GITHUB GUIDE**  

``` Let's explore the topics```  

## 1. What is github :

```
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.  
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

```
For more details please see [Github](https://github.com/about)
## 2. How github works :

---
### There are some steps which are to be followed:  

  1.Sign Up for GitHub  
  2.Install Git  
  3.Set Up Git  
  4.Create Your First Repository  
  5. Make Your First Commit

  Git is a software that helps to create checkpoint of different files so that after changes we can return back if necessary.  
  Github is a online platform where we can save out files in remote place from where every useer of github can have the access of our
files and can edit it as well can request us for accepting its changes.  
  Its work can be simply demostrated by following workflow :  
  **workspace --> index stage --> local repositories --> remote repositeries**  
  
  
## 3. CLONING:  
When we're working with a repository on GitHub, we might want to have it on our local machine to make it easier to work with. For example, to allow us to use our favorite editor, to add and remove files, or to fix conflicts. The process of copying the repository from GitHub to our local machine is called cloning (sometimes referred to on other version control systems as "checking out").  


Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. At any point, you can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.

## 4. FORKING:  
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows us to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for our own idea.  
If the project owner likes our work, they might pull our fix into the original repository.

## 5.MAKING PR'S:  
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the master branch only contains finished and approved work.  
Anyone with read permissions to a repository can create a pull request, but we must have write permissions to create a branch. If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and don't have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first.

## 6.OPENING ISSUES:
Any GitHub user can create an issue in a public repository where issues have not been disabled.  
we can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request. 
If we're using a project board to track and prioritize your work, we can convert project board notes to issues.

## 7.Some useful commands :  
* *```ls``` ---> This will list all the files in the directories.*
* *```git config``` --->  Short for “configure,” this is most useful when you’re setting up Git for the first time.*
* *```git init``` ---> Initializes a new Git repository. Until you run this command inside a repository or directory, it’s just a regular folder. Only after you input this does it accept further Git commands.*
* *```cd (name of directory)``` ---> it will take you to that directory.*
* *```cd ..``` ---> it will take you out of that directory.*
* *```mkdir (name of directory)``` ---> it will create a directory of the name you mentioned.*
* *```git status``` ---> Check the status of your repository. See which files are inside it, which changes still need to be committed, and  which branch of the repository you’re currently working on.*
* *```clear``` ---> clear the screen*
* *```cat file.txt``` ---> it shows the content present in the file.*
