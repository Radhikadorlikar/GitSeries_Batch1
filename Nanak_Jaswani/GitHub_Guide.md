# A complete Beginner Guide to git and github! :notebook_with_decorative_cover:	

_**1.What are git and github?**_

> First of all, GitHub is not git.
Many people understandably confuse the two.GitHub is a website for hosting projects that use git.
Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
It is open-source,free and distributed version control system(VCS).that makes it easier to track changes to files.
Git has trunk based development in it which involoves branches in the repository in which we can create a new branch
even while working with current branch and also we can merge the new branch with the master branch if required at any 
point.GitHub is a website on which we wan can upload projects. GitHub is a file sharing service to collaborate with different people.

_**2.How github work**_

> *__Git workflow has four fundamental stage-__*

 *a.* __Workspace:__ working directory

 *b.* __Index(stage):__ It is used as staging area between working directory and your repository

 *c.* __Local repository__ is the one on which we will make local changes, generally Local repository is on our computer. 

 *d.* __Remote repository__ is one of the server. 

> github is an online version control system.
It is based on Git and provides some other additional features of its own.
Github lets you store your code remotely known as repositories,
which you can access from anywhere or work together with your team members on a certain project.

### Forking

> Forking in GitHub is a process of creating a copy of a complete repository 
to the user's GitHub Account from another account. When a user forks a repository,
all the files in the repository are automatically copied to the user's account
on GitHub and it feels like the user's own repository.

_**steps to fork the repo**_

__Forking a repository is a simple two-step process.__
*Fork an example repository*

1.On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.

2.In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

### Cloning

> Cloning basically means you want to get a local copy of the code present 
in the repository. After cloning you can then do whatever changes you 
like in the code and then you can pull the changes back to the repository.

__Steps to create a local clone of your fork-__

1.On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.

2.Under the repository name, click Clone or download.

3.To clone the repository using HTTPS

4.Open Git Bash.

5.Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

6.Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

7.Ex-$ git clone *https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife*

8.Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

### Making a PR

> A pull request is submitted when you’ve worked on some code
from a particular branch and want to inform the others of the changes you’ve made.
>> If you want to contribute in existing repository then fork that repository first 
and do some changes in tha repository's any section even if you change documentation
of that repository's code and you think it should be in master repository of 
main repository than pull request it to main repository so that master
can see and made changes to the repository.

__Creating the pull request__

1.On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2.In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.

3.To the right of the Branch menu, click New pull request.

4.Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into,
then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.

5.Type a title and description for your pull request.

6.To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request. 

### Issue 

Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests.

__Creating an issue__

1.On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2.Under your repository name, click  Issues.

3.Click New issue.

4.If there are multiple issue types, click Get started next to the type of issue you'd like to open.
