#  **Introduction**
*Hello Everyone!*
I am Saurabh Rana from Saharanpur. I have done my schooling from *Shakumbhri Public School*. Currently, I am pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from *DIT University*.
I love watching and playing cricket. I wish our Indian Cricket team will be the World cup champion in the ODI WC 2023 and even in the upcoming T20I World Cups. As a cricket fan I love the way Mahendra Singh Dhoni leads his team in the IPL and led the Indian team in the past(2007 to 2017) but my favourate team is Mumbai Indians because of RoHitman.
My aim is to explore and learn as much as I can in the field of *Data Science* as I see my carrier as a *Data Scientist*.
I love to code in Python and exploring the data. Mainly I love to visualize the cricket stats. And i want to build my carrier as a data scientist in the cricket field.
*Thank You*
