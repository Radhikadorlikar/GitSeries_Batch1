### Clonning:
Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repo. Cloning basically does is that it makes a copy of the whole repository or the project files along with the 'git' files on your local machine, so that whenever you make changes to your file you can commit them locally in your PC and if you want then probably push it up to their server where you can see all your changes as well.


### Forking: 
“Forking” is when you create a new project based off of another project that already exists. This is an amazing feature that vastly encourages the further development of programs and other projects. If you find a project on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to, you can fork the repo, make the changes you’d like, and release the revised project as a new repo.
